## 🐛 Fix

### AI Agent Now Respects Configured Schedule Time-offs

AI Agent was fixed to always respect the time-off and unavailability settings in the schedule.

#### What was fixed?

Before, AI Agent continued offering days and times even when there were configured time-offs. Now:

- ❌ **Does NOT offer** times during time-off periods
- ❌ **Does NOT allow** creating appointments on blocked days
- ✅ **Explains to customer** the reason for unavailability
- ✅ **Automatically suggests** available alternative dates

#### Supported time-off types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Full day** | Blocks complete day (holidays, scheduled time-offs) |
| **Specific time** | Blocks only a period (lunch, meetings) |
| **By professional** | Applies time-off only to a specific professional |
| **Everyone** | Applies time-off to entire team |

#### Example AI response

> "Unfortunately we don't have service on 12/25 due to **Christmas**. Can I check other available days for you?"
