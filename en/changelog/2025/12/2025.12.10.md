## ✨ New Features

### AI Credits System in USD

AI usage control is now based on **dollar values (USD)** instead of raw tokens. This provides greater transparency and accuracy in cost calculation.

#### How it works?

Each AI model has a different cost per **1 million tokens**. The system now automatically calculates the actual cost of each request based on the model used.

#### Pricing Table by Model

|-------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **GPT-4.1** | $2.00 | $0.50 | $8.00 |
| **GPT-4.1 Mini** | $0.40 | $0.10 | $1.60 |
