## ✨ New Feature

### AI Automatically Adjusts Follow-ups Based on Conversation Context

AI now adapts or pauses follow-ups based on conversation progress, avoiding inappropriate automatic contacts.

#### What changes?

- **Smart rescheduling**: AI reschedules follow-up to a specific date when customer requests (e.g., "let's talk on Thursday" or "I'll be back on the 25th")
- **Automatic cancellation**: If customer already closed the deal or confirmed appointment, follow-up is paused
- **Context preserved**: AI resumes conversation knowing exactly what to discuss

#### How to enable?

1. Go to **Prompts** in the sidebar
2. Select the prompt linked to your flow
3. Click **Edit → Tools**
4. Add the **"Change Return Date"** action
5. Configure the target flow and node
6. Save changes
