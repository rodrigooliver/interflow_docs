## ✨ New Feature

### Duplicate Customer Blocking

System now automatically detects and blocks duplicate customer creation.

#### How does it work?

When trying to create a customer with data that already exists:

1. System checks for existing records
2. If duplicate found, shows alert
3. Option to view existing customer
4. Or merge data into existing

#### Detection criteria:

| Field | Detection |
|-------|-----------|
| Phone | ✅ Exact (ignores formatting) |
| Email | ✅ Exact (case insensitive) |
| WhatsApp | ✅ Exact (normalized) |

#### What happens if duplicate is found?

- 🚫 New creation is blocked
- 🔗 Link to existing record shown
- 🔄 Option to merge data
- ✏️ Option to update existing

::: warning ⚠️ Attention
Automatic merge can be disabled in Settings → Customers → "Allow duplicates".
