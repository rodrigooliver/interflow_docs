## 🐛 Fix

### Time Slot Selection in Flow

Fixed a bug where time slot selection in flow was not working correctly.

#### What was fixed?

- ❌ **Before**: When selecting a time in the flow, the slot was not being properly reserved
- ✅ **After**: Time selection now correctly reserves the slot and validates availability

#### Affected scenarios:

- 📅 Appointment scheduling via flow
- ⏰ Available time selection
- 🔄 Confirmation of reserved slot

#### Behavior after fix:

1. Customer selects desired time
2. System validates availability in real-time
3. Slot is temporarily reserved
4. Upon confirmation, permanent reservation is made
5. If cancelled, slot is released
