### Flows Triggered on Any Client Message

The **automated flows system** can now be **triggered on any message sent by the client**, not just the first message of the conversation! This feature offers much more flexibility in service automation and allows creating smarter conversational experiences.

#### What is it for?

- Trigger **automations** at any point in the conversation
- Automatically respond to **specific keywords**
- Create **interactive menus** during service
- Implement **commands** that clients can use at any time
- **Segment conversations** based on client intentions

#### How does it work?

**Previously**: Flows were only triggered on the client's first message (start of conversation)

**Now**: You can configure flows that monitor **all client messages** and are triggered when specific conditions are met!

#### How to configure?

1. Access **Flows** from the menu
2. **Create or edit** a flow
3. In **Flow Settings**, define:
   - **When to trigger**: "On any message" (new option!)
   - **Conditions**: Configure triggering rules
4. **Save** the flow

#### New Feature: Verification Conditions on Last Message

Within flows, you can now add **condition nodes** that check the last message sent by the client!

##### What is it for?

- **Identify keywords** in the client's message
- **Direct the flow** based on message content
- Create **dynamic menus** that respond to client input
- Implement **response validations**
- **Classify intentions** automatically

##### How to use?

1. In the **flow editor**, add a **"Condition"** node
2. Select type: **"Check last client message"**
3. Configure rules:
   - **Contains**: Checks if the message contains a word/phrase
   - **Equals**: Checks if the message is exactly equal
   - **Starts with**: Checks if the message starts with something
   - **Ends with**: Checks if the message ends with something
   - **Regular expression**: For advanced validations
4. Define **multiple keywords** (e.g., "yes", "confirm", "ok")
5. Configure **actions** for each result (true/false)
6. **Connect** to the next flow nodes

##### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Options Menu**
```
Client sends: "I need support"
→ Flow is triggered
→ System responds: "Type 1 for sales, 2 for technical support"
→ Condition checks if response contains "1" or "2"
→ Directs to the correct department
```

**Example 2: Confirmation Validation**
```
System asks: "Confirm appointment for tomorrow at 2pm?"
→ Condition checks if message contains: "yes", "confirm", "ok"
→ If YES: Confirms appointment
→ If NO: Requests new date
```

**Example 3: Service Keywords**
```
Client in service sends: "cancel order"
→ Specific flow is automatically triggered
→ System starts cancellation process
→ Transfers to cancellations team
```

**Example 4: Quick Commands**
```
Client sends: "/status"
→ Flow detects command
→ Returns order status automatically
```

#### Features

- ✅ **Multiple triggers**: Configure multiple keywords per condition
- ✅ **Case insensitive**: Doesn't differentiate uppercase/lowercase
- ✅ **Regex support**: Advanced validations with regular expressions
- ✅ **Prioritization**: Define execution order of flows
